Mid-term exam??\\
Final exam - beginning of January: Multiple choices + 2 open question

** Textbook
Mathematical Analysis I (Canuto, Claudio, Tabacco, Anita)

* Sets
$A=\{a_1, a_2, ..., a_{10}\}$
Capital letter to identify them

Symbol =belongs to=\\
$a_2 \in A$ is true if $a_2$ is in the $A$ set

Venn diagram is a set representation

** Cardinality
$|A|$ is the number of elements in a set\\

** Intersections
$A \cap B$ The set with only the elements that belong to both sets

** Union
$A \cup B$ The set with elements that belong to either set

*Examples*
$$
A=\{\text{all natural numbers multiple of 3}\}\\ 
A=\{0, 3, 6, 9, ...\}\\ 
B=\{\text{all even numbers}\}\\ 
B=\{0, 2, 4, 6, ...\}\\ 
\\ 
A \cap B = \{0, 6, 12, ...\}\\ 
A \cup B = \{0, 2, 3, 4, ...\}\\ 
$$

** Subsets
$B \subset A$
if $B$ is a subset of $A$ then all elements in $B$ also belong to $A$

$A \subset A$ is true

if $B \subset A$ then $x \in B \Rightarrow x \in A$

$\emptyset$ is the empty set\\
$\emptyset \subset A$ (Every set has at least 2 subsets: itself and $\emptyset$)

* Sets of Numbers
** Naturals
$\mathbb{N} = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}$
Positive integers (and 0) with $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$
The  additions ($a+b$) and multiplications ($a \cdot b$) (subtraction cannot be done everytime)

_*Neutrals*_\\
0 for Additions ($a+0=a$)
1 for Multiplications ($a \cdot =a$)

$\mathbb{N}_+ = \{1, 2, 3, 4, ...\}$

** Integers
$\mathbb{Z} = \{0, \pm1, \pm2, \pm3, ...\}$
with $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$
The following operations are possible
- additions ($a+b$),
- multiplications ($a \cdot b$)
- and subtractions ($a-b$/$a+(-b)$)

$\forall a \in \mathbb{Z} \exists b \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ such that } a+b=0 \land b=-a$

** Rationals
$\mathbb{Q} = \{\frac{k}{n}, n \in \mathbb{N}_+, k \in \mathbb{Z}, n \text{ & } k \text{ have no common divisors } \}$

$\forall a \in \mathbb{Q}$ with a $\neq 0 \exists b \in Q \text{ such that } a \cdot b = 1 \land b=\frac{1}{a} \land a=\frac{1}{b}$

The Line of Numbers is a geometric representation
There is no $p \in \mathbb{Q} \text{ such that } p^2 = 2$ which means that $\sqrt{2} \notin \mathbb{Q}$

However since the diagonal of a square that has $l = 1$ is
$\sqrt{2}$ then $\sqrt{2}$ must exist, otherwise we wouldn't be able
to represent numbers in a continuous line

*** Proof (by contradiction)
To prove that proposition $p$ implies proposition $q$ we prove that proposition $\lnot p$ implies both $q$ and $\lnot q$
This is a contradiction, since $q$ and $\lnot q$ cannot both be true simultaneously (they're mutually exclusive)

To prove that $p \notin \mathbb{Q} \text{ such that } p^2 = 2$ we prove that $p \in \mathbb{Q}: p^2 \neq 2$ is not true\\
Suppose $p \in \mathbb{Q}$, so $p = \frac{m}{n}$ where $m, n$ have no common divisor
$$
\frac{m^2}{n^2} = 2 \Rightarrow m^2 = 2n^2\\
\Downarrow\\
m^2 \text{ is even } \Rightarrow m \text{ is even } \Rightarrow m=2k\\
(2k)^2 = 2n^2 \Rightarrow 4k^2 = 2n^2 \Rightarrow 2k^2 = n^2\\
\Downarrow\\
n^2 \text{ is even } \Rightarrow n \text{ is even }
$$
If both $m$ and $n$ are even then they have at least one common divisor
This means that, $p \in \mathbb{Q} = \frac{m}{n}$ and $p \notin \mathbb{Q}$ because $m, n$ have at least one common divisor
Since $p \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $p \notin \mathbb{Q}$ cannot be both true, the assumption that $p \in \mathbb{Q}$ must be false

Real numbers are the rest of the numbers in the line.
Since there are infinitely many rational numbers, we can approximate any real number
with at least one rational.\\
Real numbers can be represented with infinite
decimal digits/decimal development\\
\(\frac{1}{3} = 0.33333...\) Periodic\\
\(\sqrt{2} = 1.41...\) Aperiodic

** Reals $\mathbb{R}$
Were defined very recently (around 1870 - 80) ($\sqrt{2} \in \mathbb{R}$)

*** Properties
$a+b$, $a \cdot b$, $-a$, $\frac{1}{a} \text{ if } a \neq 0$

All numbers are ordered, if $a \neq b$ then $a < b \lor a > b$

* Operation Properties

- $a \cdot (b+c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c$
- if $c > 0 \land a < b \Rightarrow a \cdot c < b \cdot c$

let \(A \subset \mathbb{R}\)\\
\(max A = b \text{ such that } b \in A \land b >= a \forall a \in A\)\\
if $A=\{x\in \mathbb{R}, x <= 1\}$ then $max(A) = 1$.\\
Not all sets have a maximum (some sets are infinite), for example $B=\{x \in \mathbb{R}, x < 1\}$ has
infinite numbers\\

$B$ has a Supremum (the supremum is the lowest of all majorants)
\[
sup A = b \text{ if } b >= a \forall a \in A\\ 
\text{if } c >= a \forall a \in A \Rightarrow sup(A) <= c
\]
if $\exists max(A) \Rightarrow max(A) = sup(A)$

*** Axiom of $\mathbb{R}$
every set $A$ that is (upper) bounded (meaning that
$\exists M \in \mathbb{R} \text{ such that } M >= a \forall a \in A$) has a supremum

*** Theorem
\[
\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \forall a > 0, a \in \mathbb{R} \ 
\exists \text{ unique } x \in \mathbb{R}, x > 0 \text{ such that } x^n=a
\]
